            in the near areas, We hav a huge campus and all the other thigns which are required by the students 
            and othe things like this and this and this and this and other things like this and also many othter things like this andother things like this\

            I'd like to use this approach, but my buttons are created dynamically (i.e. in code) in a grid control, not declaratively (actually, I'm using Xamarin free version, so Mono lib). Doesn't seem to be a straightforward method to set just any attribute
